As discussed in further detail in the relection.pdf, my site main design feature is the interactive bun builder form. My design is not achievable without interaction, so I have some rudimentary Js work done but not functioning. 
That is why there are only two “pages” because the bun builder page was designed to cut out the extraneous page by the “product browsing page and product detail page” design.
